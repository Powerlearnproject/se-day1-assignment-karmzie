Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
soft ware engineering is the use of instructions(code)to design apps,websites to solve real world problems
importance in the tecnology industry:
it used in building apps for example health apps that are used by individuals to communicate to health professionals virtually
games: people love games it helps them during leisures or for fun

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
they are:
Agile development: it emphasizes the interactive development cycle with frequent feed backs allowing for quick adaptation to changing requirements and delivering working softwares in shorter timeframes
object oriented programming: it helped programmers to use objects to design softwares that encapsulate data and behaviour
structured programming methods: this introduced steps like modularity, functions and control flow structures leading to a more maintainable and understandable software

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning: defining the project scope, goals, budget,and resource allocation
requirement analysis: gathering and documenting detailed user needs and functionality that the software should have 
Design: creating the software architecture,user interface design and system flow to outline the structure and functionality of the software
Implementation: writing the actual code for the software based on the design specifications
Testing: executing various tests to identify and fix bugs ensuring the software meets quality standards
Deployment: releasing the completed software to the production environment thereby making it accessible to users
Maintenance: ongoing supports and updates to the software after deployment including bug fixes,feature enhancements



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
water fall is a linear, sequential project management approach with distinct phases where each stage must be completed before moving to the next while Agile is an iterative methodology that allows for flexibility and continous adapting to changing requirements
agile is better suited for projects with uncertain requirements while water fall is ideal for projects with well defined needs and minimal changes
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
web or application developers: most software developers take up this role to design webs or lead generation changes
software testing: aside from coding and designing software developers should be able to spot and fix bugs efficiently
system administrators: They are responsible for the upkeep and configuration of multiuser computers

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
importance of IDEs:
efficiency: in coding games they work like turbo boosters helping you crank codes like a pro
Code management: they help to track changes and collaborate with your crew making the work easier 
importance of VCS:
merging of code changes: this is done effortlessly by developers where they can easily merge changes to the code database
Prevents Data Loss and Manages Assets:The centralized repository saves all the changes which result in securing all the code data in one place.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
they are:
 Lack of Workflow Visibility:A lot of development teams suffer because of a vague understanding of the engineering processes within their organization. Many donâ€™t have clarity about the status of the projects, the activities and challenges of the individuals, and whatnot. 
 how to overcome:Invest in tools that empower your teams to make data-driven decisions like Project management tools, analytical tools
 Broken SDLC Processes: your software develpment could be broken at any of the multiple levels like: poor requirement gathering, poor crises response operating procedures 
 how to overcome:Use an engineering management platform to analyze higher PR reviews, and PR ratio, and identify optimal review workload for your team. The higher the ratio, the better your chance to understand how overburdened your devs are, or if they are compromising on their review time over other non-core tasks. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing: is a method of testing individual units or components of a software application. It is typically done by developers and is used to ensure that the individual units of the software are working as intended. 
Importance:It helps to ensure that changes to the code do not introduce new bugs.
It makes the code more modular and easier to understand and maintain.
Integration testing:is a method of testing how different units or components of a software application interact with each other. It is used to identify and resolve any issues that may arise when different units of the software are combined.
Importance:It helps to identify and resolve issues that may arise when different units of the software are combined.
System testing:System testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the overall functionality and performance of a complete and fully integrated software solution.
Importance:It will test the entire product or software so that we will easily detect the errors or defects that cannot be identified during the unit testing and integration testing.
Acceptance testing:It is formal testing according to user needs, requirements, and business processes conducted to determine whether a system satisfies the acceptance criteria or not and to enable the users to determine wether to accept the sysytem or not
importance:This testing helps the project team to know the further requirements from the users directly as it involves the users for testing.
Automated test execution.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is writing a set of commands and the AI respnds based on what it was commanded to do
Importance: Prompt engineering makes AI applications more efficient and effective.
Improved user experience

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt: "Where to purchase a shirt." 
improved prompt:"You are a sales assistant for a clothing company. A user, based in Alabama, United States, is asking you where to purchase a shirt. Respond with the three nearest store locations that currently stock a shirt."
the improved prompt is more effective because it gave a detailed information of what you are asking the AI MODEL.
